## Problem 1

First, define a path to the dataset.

``` r
path_to_data = "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx"
```

Read the Mr. Trashwheel dataset.

``` r
trashwheel_df =
  read_xlsx(
          path = path_to_data,
          sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
          range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(
          sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
          sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
  )
```

Read precipitation data\! For 2018 and 2017

``` r
precip_2018 =
  read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
  ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month) %>%
  mutate(year = 2018) %>%
  relocate(year)

precip_2017 =
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
  ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month) %>%
  mutate(year = 2017) %>%
  relocate(year)
```

Now combine annual precipitation datasets and convert month to a
character variable.

``` r
month_df = 
        tibble(
                month = 1:12,
                month_name = month.name
        )

precip_df = 
        bind_rows(precip_2018, precip_2017)

precip_df =
        left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

This dataset contains the information from the Mr. Trashwheel trash
collector located in Balitmore, Maryland. When trash enters the inner
harbor, Mr. Trashwheel collects and dispenses the trash into a dumpster.
This dataset contains information on the year, month, and trash
collected, such as sports balls, cigarettes, glass bottles, and more.
There are 344 rows in the final trashwheel dataset and 24 rows in the
final precipitation dataset. There are also additional data sheets
including month precipitation data. In this dataset:

  - The median number of sports balls found in a dumpster in 2017 was 8
  - The total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33 inches

## Problem 2

``` r
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
```

Read NYC Transit dataset. Retain line, station name, station
latitude/longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and
ADA compliance.

``` r
nyc_transit_df =
              read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(
    line, 
    station_name,
    station_latitude,
    station_longitude,
    6:16,
    entry,
    vending,
    entrance_type,
    ada) %>%
  mutate(entry = recode(entry,
                        YES = "TRUE",
                        NO = "FALSE")) 
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_double(),
    ##   Route9 = col_double(),
    ##   Route10 = col_double(),
    ##   Route11 = col_double(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

This dataset shows the line, station name, station latitude/longitude,
routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA compliance data in
NYC Transit. So far, I have cleaned the variable names using `janitor`
and I have selected specific columns from the larger dataset using
`select`. Lastly, I changed the character values in the entry column to
logical values using `recode`. In the cleaned dataset, there are 465
distinct stations. There are 468 stations that are ADA compliant. And,
the proportion of station entrances/exits wihtout vending that allow
entrance is 37.704918%.

Reformat the data so that route number and route name are distinct
variables. How many distinct stations serve the A train? Of the stations
that serve the A train, how many are ADA compliant?

``` r
reformat_transit_df=
  mutate(nyc_transit_df,
    route8 = as.character(route8),
    route9 = as.character(route9),
    route10 = as.character(route10),
    route11 = as.character(route11)) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_number",
    values_to = "route_name",
    names_prefix = "route"
  )
```

There are 273 distinct stations that serve the A train. Of these
stations, 107 are ADA compliant.

## Problem 3

First, clean the data in pols-month.csv and convert month number into
month name.

``` r
pols_month_df =
    read_csv("./data/pols-month.csv") %>%
  separate(
    mon, 
    into = c('year', 'month', 'day'),
    convert = TRUE
  ) %>%
  mutate(month = month.abb[month])
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   mon = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   prez_gop = col_double(),
    ##   gov_gop = col_double(),
    ##   sen_gop = col_double(),
    ##   rep_gop = col_double(),
    ##   prez_dem = col_double(),
    ##   gov_dem = col_double(),
    ##   sen_dem = col_double(),
    ##   rep_dem = col_double()
    ## )

Create a `president` variable taking values `gop` and `dem` and remove
`prez_dem` and `prez_gop`, and remove the day variable.

``` r
pols_month_df = 
mutate(pols_month_df,
       president = case_when(
         prez_gop == 1 ~ 'gop',
         prez_dem == 1 ~ 'dem'
       )) %>%
  select(-c(prez_gop, prez_dem, day))
```

Second, clean the data in snp.csv using similar process to the above.
And, convert month number into month name.

``` r
snp_df = 
  read_csv("./data/snp.csv") %>%
  separate(
    date,
    into = c("month", "day", "year"),
    sep = "/",
    convert = TRUE
  ) %>%
  select(-c(day)) %>%
  mutate(month = month.abb[month])
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   date = col_character(),
    ##   close = col_double()
    ## )

For consistency across datasets, arrange according to year and month,
and organize so that `year` and `month` are the leading columns.

``` r
snp_df =
  head(arrange(snp_df, year, month), 787) %>%
  select(year, month, close)
```

Third, tidy the unemployment data so that it can be merged with the
previous datasets. This process will involve switching from “wide” to
“long” format; ensuring that key variables have the same name; and
ensuring that key variables take the same values.

``` r
unemployment_df =
  read_csv("./data/unemployment.csv") %>%
pivot_longer(
  Jan:Dec,
  names_to = "month", 
  values_to = "unemployment_rate") %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   Year = col_double(),
    ##   Jan = col_double(),
    ##   Feb = col_double(),
    ##   Mar = col_double(),
    ##   Apr = col_double(),
    ##   May = col_double(),
    ##   Jun = col_double(),
    ##   Jul = col_double(),
    ##   Aug = col_double(),
    ##   Sep = col_double(),
    ##   Oct = col_double(),
    ##   Nov = col_double(),
    ##   Dec = col_double()
    ## )

Join the datasets by merging snp into pols, and merging unemployment
into the result.

``` r
pols_snp_joined_df = 
  left_join(pols_month_df, snp_df)
```

    ## Joining, by = c("year", "month")

``` r
pols_snp_unemployment_joined_df =
  left_join(pols_snp_joined_df, unemployment_df)
```

    ## Joining, by = c("year", "month")

The joined dataset has merged year, and month data. It has also added
the non-shared data from the three individual datasets. The joined
dataset has 822 rows and 11 columns. The dataset has years ranging from
1947 to 2015. Some important variables in the joined dataset are
unemployment rate, presidential party (under variable president), and
number of republican and democratic governors, senators, and
representatives.
